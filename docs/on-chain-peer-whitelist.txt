The feature of on-chain-peer-whitelist is implemented in branch "on-chain-peer-whitelist".

We had configuration file based peer whitelist feature implemented in the ethdbchain application,
no any code changes are needed in tendermint. That feature is node specific, not chain specific.

I'm implementing the multi-ledger feature in branch "ethan", which is based on "main" branch.
The on-chain-peer-whitelist feature is not compatible with the multi-ledger feature, since we
don't know which chain to get the whitelist from.

So we need to be sure not to rebase the "main" branch on "on-chain-peer-whitelist" branch.

To build the ocpw feature, the projects ethdbchain and tendermint need to be on their "on-chain-peeer-whitelist" branch".
